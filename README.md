Join us in celebrating NYC Open Data Week! This two-part workshop and data jam will explore data analysis and visualization utilizing NYC environmental data. In the first half of this workshop, participants will explore ChatGPTâ€™s data capabilities and contrast them with their own analyses via Google Co-lab. In the second half, participants will work in small groups to ideate and produce creative, accessible projects that showcase their data findings (i.e; in the form of collages, songs, stories, etc.). This workshop will explore the importance of data presentations and their impact on viewer perceptions. People from all backgrounds and coding levels are welcome! Beginner friendly.


### This workshop is structured as follows:
  1. Introductions: the CSC, NYC Open Data Week 2024
  2. *Part I:* Learn how to analyze a dataset and generate visualizations in Google Colab, then extend these findings in ChatGPT.
  3. *Part II:* Participants split into groups for a data jam which focuses on creative ways to present data (songs, collages, stories,
     illustrations, poems, animations, etc.)
  5. Final takeaways and project share-outs!
